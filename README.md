# Culvert Ranking
## Synopsis

These scripts update, sort and rank records based on input culvert parameters in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

## Script Inputs

The needed inputs are based on an ArcGIS Collector database.  Certain culvert criteria is used to evaluate whether a culvert needs to be analyzed further.

## Motivation

These scripts were developed to help a colleague sort and rank culvert inventory data.  Culverts that were sized improperly, or were damaged are brought to a ranking level for replacement.  Culverts are ranked based on weighted metrics, leaving the highest priority culverts at the top of the list.

## Installation

Download the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet if you want to check it out.

## Tests

This script was developed and tested on Microsoft Excel 2013
